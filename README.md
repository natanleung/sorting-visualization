# Sorting Visualization

Sorting Visualization animates several comparison sorting algorithms on a list of randomized elements.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  

In the project directory, you can run:

```shell
npm run start
```

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

```shell
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
